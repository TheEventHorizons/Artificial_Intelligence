# COVID-19 Detection Project

This repository contains Python scripts for a COVID-19 detection project. The project includes data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and optimization.

## Code Files

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- File: `eda_covid_detection.py`
- Description: This script performs exploratory data analysis on the COVID-19 dataset. It includes data loading, cleaning, and visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.

### 2. Modeling and Evaluation

- File: `modeling_and_evaluation.py`
- Description: This script includes the initial modeling and evaluation procedures. It covers decision tree modeling, feature selection, and evaluation using various metrics. Different imputation and preprocessing strategies are explored.

### 3. Model Improvement and Optimization

- File: `preprocessing.py`
- Description: This script focuses on improving model performance and optimizing hyperparameters. It introduces different models, evaluates their performance, and employs techniques like grid search and randomized search for hyperparameter tuning.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the scripts in the following order:
   - `eda_covid_detection.py`
   - `modeling_and_evaluation.py`
   - `preprocessing.py`

3. Adjust configurations and parameters within the scripts based on your preferences and dataset location.
